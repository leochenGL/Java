This  Java/Maven Project is about how to register a custom String array user-defined type using Hibernate with XML.


Before Run  MainTest.java  class (testCases) you should create some tables with the following script:

/src/main/resources/sql/tablesCreation.sql

By default its pointing to public schema. You can change hibernate connection properties and other configs in "/src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml" file.

You can define  more test cases in /src/test/java/MainTest.java class.
